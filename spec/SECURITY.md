# AXTP Security Model & Threat Analysis

## Status: IN PROGRESS

This document will contain the full security analysis for AXTP, including:

1. **Threat Model** — comprehensive adversarial analysis of the protocol
2. **Attack Surface Map** — all entry points and data flows
3. **Mitigation Matrix** — specific controls for each identified threat
4. **Cryptographic Requirements** — signing, encryption, and verification standards
5. **Identity & Authentication** — agent identity verification mechanisms
6. **Incident Response** — procedures for compromised pools or agents

## Priority Threats Under Analysis

- Experience poisoning (deliberate and drift-based)
- Trust score manipulation and amplification attacks
- Data exfiltration from organizational pools
- Model extraction through systematic experience retrieval
- Supply chain attacks via compromised agent frameworks
- Privacy leakage through experience correlation

## Contributing

Security analysis contributions are especially welcome. If you identify a vulnerability in the protocol design, please open an issue tagged `security` or contact the maintainers directly.
